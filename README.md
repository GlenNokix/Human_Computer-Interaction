Designed and built the main interface of the elderly care system in the Unity engine, completing scene setup, element arrangement, and functional integration to enhance the interfaceâ€™s efficiency and usability.
Used the Kinect sensor to capture user motion data, employed OpenCV for image processing, and developed real-time interactive functions to accurately map user movements into the virtual environment.
Collected user behaviors data from the Kinect device, analyzed the data and provided quantifiable insights for system function optimization and performance adjustments.
